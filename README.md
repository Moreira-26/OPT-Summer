# OPT-Summer

## Description

During my internship, I developed an web application that allows multiple public transport planners to collaboratively create a planning network. I incorporated [Redis](https://redis.io)  as a cache for faster data access and utilized [SocketIO](https://socket.io) to enable real-time collaboration among planners.
